# Buffered channels

Well one of the main feature of Golang ( and probably the most important one ) is its way to concurrent programming. In the last video we talked about the basics of concurrency and in this video we go a little bit further to unbuffered channels and some other features like close and range. At last we create a Semaphore using what we've learned in this video about Golang and software engineering!

In this video, I talked about each of these codes. Check it out if you want to see how they are implemented **step by step**: https://youtu.be/SHMNwdY7sYo
